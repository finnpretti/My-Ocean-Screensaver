# My-Ocean-Screensaver

Hello, welcome to my ocean screensaver website. I created this as part of an assignment for my **Computer Studies** course (ICS20). The rules of the assignment were as follows:

- The program had to be animated and could not interact with the mouse or keyboard
- There had to be at least one array
- There had to be at least one loop
- There had to be at least one custom object and it has at least one custom method
- There had to be at least one graphic object
- My name had to be continuously displayed at one of the bottom corners of the canvas
- The program must run without any syntax or runtime errors
- The program had to work even when the screen size is different
- The code had to be thoroughly commented

I chose to do an ocean theme because I felt like it would make for a *peaceful* yet *vibrant* screensaver experience.
